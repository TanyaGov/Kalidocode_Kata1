# 📗 Kalidocode String Kata 1

## Requirements:

#### Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)

##### 1. The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0), for example, “” or “1” or “1,2”
- Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers
- Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
- Remember to refactor after each passing test
##### 2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
##### 3. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas)
- the following input is ok: “1\n2,3”  (will equal 6)
- the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n” (no need to prove it - just clarifying)
##### 4. Support custom delimiters:
- to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this:   
  		“//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return 3 where the default delimiter is ‘;’
- the first line is optional - all existing scenarios should still be supported (i.e. default delimiters )
##### 5. Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception with the message “Negatives not allowed: {negative numbers}” where “{negetive numbers}” is the negative numbers that were found in the string. If more than one negative is found in the input, show them all in the exception message.
##### 6. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001  = 2
##### 7. Support custom delimiters of any length with the following format:  “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//***\n1***2***3” should return 6.
##### 8. Allow multiple custom delimiters like this:  “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example “//[*][%]\n1*2%3” should return 6. Note that the square brackets seen here are only required for multiple custom delimiters. A single custom delimiter (requirement 7) does not need the square brackets.
##### 9. Make sure you can also handle multiple custom delimiters with lengths longer than one character
